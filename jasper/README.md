## Major Updates
- 2014-08-09: [Modularized STT implementation](https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client/pull/118) with Google Speech API example, thanks to astahlman. Running `populate.py` after updating is highly recommended.
- 2014-07-11: More [platform-independent audio output](https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client/pull/100). Thank you, astahlman!
- 2014-05-27: The network setup wizard has been removed because of unreliability. The client code and documentation has been updated, requiring new users to manually configure their `/etc/network/interfaces` file.
